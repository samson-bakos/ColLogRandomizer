# OSRS Collection Log Randomizer

A tool that randomly generates an item from Old School RuneScape's collection log. It scrapes data directly from the [OSRS Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Collection_log) to stay up to date with changes to the log.

## Features

- Generate a random item from the OSRS collection log
- Displays the item name, source, category, and icon
- Shows all locations where an item can be obtained if it appears in multiple places
- Data is sourced directly from the OSRS Wiki
- Clean, simple interface

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/osrs-collection-log-randomizer.git
cd osrs-collection-log-randomizer
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

4. The application will open in your default web browser. If it doesn't, navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

## How It Works

1. The application scrapes collection log data from the OSRS Wiki.
2. Data is cached locally to avoid repeated scraping.
3. When you click "Roll for Random Collection Log Item," a random item is selected from the database.
4. The item's name, source, category, and icon are displayed.
5. If the item appears in multiple places in the collection log, all sources are shown.

- `collection_log_randomizer.py` - Backend logic for scraping data and selecting random items
- `collection_log_data.json` - Cached collection log data (created on first run)

## Implementation Details

The collection log contains around 1,766 total slots with 1,568 unique items. Some items appear in multiple places (like Dragon pickaxe which can be obtained from several bosses). Our randomizer gives each unique item an equal chance of being selected.
